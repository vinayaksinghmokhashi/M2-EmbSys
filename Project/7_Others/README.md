## How does simulation works?
In real-time the actuation in motors is based on the sensory input of MPU6050. But here in Simulide due to the non availability of specific components I tried to replace the functionality of this sensor by a switch and a potentiometer.

Switch is used to control the direction of motor direction where as potentiometer used to control the speed of the motors based on its resister values.
