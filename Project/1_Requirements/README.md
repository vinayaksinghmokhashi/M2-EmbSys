# TWO WHEELED BALANCING ROBOT AS AN EMBEDDED SYSTEM

## 1.	Problem description

### Two- wheeled self balancing robot is designed using the concepts of embedded system design. This embedded system is an assembly of various sensors and actuators with Arduino as a processing unit. It is automatic that carries a payload from source location to the destination according to user commands by balancing itself based on sensory inputs.

## 2.	Requirements: 

### Requirement design and analyzes of customer needs
